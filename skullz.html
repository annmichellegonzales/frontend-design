furthermore, spans are inline, and this is also reflected in the css.-->

<h3>A demonstration of how to access a SPAN element</h3>

<!--the span is an inline element. in this case, it is used as an id. id's use # in css, while classes use a .
the span also contains a style tage in which the color is blue.-->
<!--<p>My mother has <span id="mySpan" style="color:blue;">blue</span> eyes.</p>-->

<!--I added background-color to see what would happen. -->
<p>My mother has <span id="mySpan" style="background-color:blue; color: yellow">blue</span> eyes.</p>

<p>Click the button to get the color of the span element.</p>

<!--onclick invokes the js function. button tag gives the shape and behavior of a button.-->
<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

<!--this id is where the js will show its response after the buttons is clicked with its "onclick behavior".
it has an id of "demo" which is used on the getElementById section.-->
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
    // javascript function with the name of myFunction
    // a variable is created called x which grabs "mySpan" fromt he document with the getElementById method.
    // style and color mean where the get is getting its info from
    //the "demo" part is where the js pops up its response. i tried doing background color, and it didn't work the way i thought.


    function myFunction() {
        var x = document.getElementById("mySpan").style.color;
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    }
