/*    the dot class uses height and width to give the sizing of the dots. the background color is bbb that means a sort of gray
border-radius is what changes the shape of how round a shape is, its border which makes it circular at 50%.
when changed to 75% or 100%, nothing really happened. the circles look the same. at 25%, the circles become more square.
inline block means they are all on the same line in their block.*/

<h3>A demonstration of how to access a SPAN element</h3>

<p>My mother has <span id="mySpan" style="color:blue;">blue</span> eyes.</p>

<p>Click the button to get the color of the span element.</p>

<!--onclick invokes the js function-->
<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
